# Escape
You spawn inside your house hiding in a bush to reflect detection. You have to leave your house and move along the street without getting detected by the police. Collision detection is disabled to make it easier, if you move out of the street, the cops will find out and they all will go after you. For visibility, you can use the scroll wheel to move the bush around yourself, and to move use WASD. Reach the end of the finish line to win :D Loading takes a while, so do not press `Space` more than once, if you get caught the game ends! Enjoy :D
